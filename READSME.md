**By Gabriel – Business Data Analyst**

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover key business insights, evaluate performance across products, regions, and time, and provide actionable recommendations to improve revenue and profitability. The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, focusing on data cleaning, KPI calculation, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.

## 🎯 Business Objectives  
- Identify top-performing and underperforming products  
- Analyze monthly and yearly sales trends  
- Evaluate regional performance  
- Understand customer purchasing behavior  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for business growth  

## 📁 Dataset  
The dataset represents a fictional retail company and contains:
- Order Date  
- Region  
- Product Category  
- Product Name  
- Sales  
- Quantity  
- Profit  
- Customer Segment  

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- Microsoft Excel  
  - Data Cleaning  
  - Pivot Tables  
  - Charts & Dashboards  
  - Basic Statistical Analysis  

## 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
- Total Revenue  
- Total Profit  
- Profit Margin  
- Sales Growth Rate  
- Top 5 Products by Revenue  
- Regional Contribution to Total Sales  
- Customer Segment Performance  

## 🔎 Analysis Process  
1. Data Cleaning  
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Standardized date formats  
2. Data Transformation  
   - Created calculated columns for Profit Margin  
   - Grouped data by month, region, and category  
3. Exploratory Analysis  
   - Pivot tables for sales by region, product, and time  
   - Trend analysis for monthly and yearly performance  
4. Visualization  
   - Sales trend line chart  
   - Revenue by region bar chart  
   - Top products ranking  
   - Profit by category dashboard  

## 📈 Key Insights  
- A small number of products contribute the majority of total revenue (Pareto Principle).  
- One region consistently outperforms others in both sales and profit.  
- Certain product categories generate high revenue but low profit margins, indicating high costs or discounting.  
- Sales peak during specific months, showing strong seasonality.  

## 💡 Business Recommendations  
- Increase marketing focus on top-performing regions and products.  
- Review pricing and cost structure for low-margin high-volume products.  
- Optimize inventory planning based on seasonal demand patterns.  
- Develop targeted promotions for underperforming customer segments.  

## 📊 Dashboard  
A dynamic Excel dashboard was created to visualize:
- Monthly sales trends  
- Regional performance  
- Product contribution  
- Profitability metrics  

(Screenshot of dashboard will be added in the `/dashboard` folder.)

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Rebuild this analysis using SQL for data extraction  
- Create an interactive Power BI version of the dashboard  
- Automate reporting using Python in future iterations
